### Describe a bad thing that happened to you.

An extremely unfortunate thing happened to me recently. My home was burglarized last week.

This is how it happened. As I said before, my girl friend ofter travel for bussiness, last friday, when she came back in the afternoon, she wanted to find out a handbag in wardrobe, but she didn't find it, and she remember clearly that it was there. Then, she suddenly discovered that all the handbags in this shelf were missing. The valuable jewelry in the box on the dressing table was also missing. That's when she realized our home had been burglarized. She called my home and called the police.


### What is the response from the police?
