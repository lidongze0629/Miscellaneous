### Describe a bad thing that happened to you.

An extremely unfortunate thing happened to me recently. My home was burglarized last week.

This is how it happened. As I said before, my girl friend ofter travel for bussiness, last friday, when she came back in the afternoon, she wanted to find out a handbag in wardrobe, but she didn't find it, and she remember clearly that it was there. Then, she suddenly discovered that all the handbags in this shelf were missing. The valuable jewelry in the box on the dressing table was also missing. That's when she realized our home had been burglarized. She called my home and called the police.


### What is the response from the police? 

At that evening, Two policemen came to our home, asked us some details about what happened in those days, recorded the missing items and their values, copied the surveillance video of the community. One of the police is technician, he extract fingerprints on site. After doing thers necessary work, let us wait for the results.


### What's the recent progress?

The recent progress is that the status of the case has transitioned from being under consideration to being formally registered. Therefore, we think there is hope and we should trust the police.


### How much was lost in this theft?

A few hundred of thousand, including the handbags, jewelry, and watch. But what's weird is that the electronic lock shows no signs of damage, only the items of her wardrobe and jewelry box were missing. Neither my watch nor the cash in another wardrobewas missing. We initially suspect that an acquaintance may have committed the crime.

### 
There is hope for solving the case, but retrieving the lost items is relatively slim, because the thieves will quickly sell the stolen goods, and they have special channels to sell the stolen goods. Otherwise, the amount will be at least 10 years in prison.
