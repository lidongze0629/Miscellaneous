### What type of programmes do you find funny on TV?
In my perspective, some popular comedy genres include sitcoms like "Friends" are entertaining. And some Chinese traditional dramas like comic skit, monologue comic talk are also funny.

I prefer (the) sitcoms, such as Friends. they have the funny plots and also can help me improve my English skills. (what kind of plots do you think funny?)

### Do you like watching TV?
I like(d) watching animation like Doraemon when I was child. (why, example) However, with the development of the internet, I didnt have much time for full TV shows. Instead, I tended to watch short videos during fragmented time. (when did this change happen, why you change your habits (I didn't have time for full TV show, break time))

### How often do you watch TV?
I only watch TV on weekends when there's a football match in one of the top 5 European leagues. (why)

I prefer the sitcoms. It can bring me joy and laughter, provide a break from the stresses of daily life.
(As I said erarlier, I perfer sitcoms)

### What is your favourite TV show now?
I like the entire series of Friends It's well-known American sitcom, which explores various aspects of friendship, love, and personal growth. Watching the relationships grow and change between these characters resonates (with) me on an emotional level. It can also bring to joy and laughter, provide a break from the stresses of daily life.

### What was your favourite show when you were a child?
As a child, I really liked the Doraemon, an animation series from Japan. This show features a lovable main character in Doraemon, a robotic cat from the future. I (was) drawn to his playful and helpful nature, as well as his gadgets and inventions that make everyday life more exciting. When I was a child, I fantasized I could have the same robotic cat every day.

### What are the most popular TV shows in your country?
Definitely idol drama, possibly this is due to young people's habit of chasing stars. When their favorite idols appear on-screen, it can satisfy many fantasies of these young people.

### Has the internet affected your viewing habits?
Yes, the internet has significant impact on people's viewing habits, including my own, when it comes to TV. With the rise of streaming platforms and online video content, I have more options and flexibility in what, when, and where I watch. The internet has made it easier for me to access a wide range of content on-demand, allowing me to customize my viewing experience to my preferences. Therefore, I watch less TV than I used to.

// I've experienced this trend first-hand, as well, and therefore watch less TV than I used to(did in the past).

### How many hours a day do you spend watching television?
I only watch TV on weekends when there is football match, which typically lastes around an hour and a half.

### Do you think children in your country watch too much television?
Its related to the specific families and their parenting styles. Some families ignore the potential effects of excessive television watching, such as impaired vision, (and) believe the children could be quieter during watching time. (Other families) may prioritize the limitation of watching time and encourage other physical activities.

I tend to agree with the latter(second group / former / latter). Children need more outdoor activities for cognition and socialze.

### Do you think television is useful for education in schools?
Yes, but only when it is a high-quality TV show, such as documentary or something else educational. It can help children expand their horizons and enrich their experiences, such as by witnessing how vastness the world is. However, I think animation like "Tom and Jerry", doesnt serve any purpose. Meanwhile, it's also crucial for schools to be aware of the potential effects of excessive television watching.

### What do you think is the difference between watching a live performance and watching it on TV?
I think the biggest difference is atmosphere. During a live performance, you can immerse yourself into the drama, even interact with the actors. But on TV, the camera angles may influence what you see, and the sound quality might be different than what you would experience in person. (crowd interaction, the feeling is different)

### What is the distinction between information on TV and information in magazines?
I think the information on TV and in magazines differ in several ways.

First of all, is the timeliness. TV news can provide real-time information, ensuring that viewers are up-to-date with the latest events. Magazines, on the other hand, have longer production cycles and are often published on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, meaning the information may not be as current.

Second, is the format. TV provides information through audiovisual means, combining spoken words, visuals, and sound effects. Magazines, in contrast, convey information primarily through text and static visuals, such as photographs or illustrations.

In addition, TV provides information in a more immediate and easily accessible manner, as viewers can simply turn on the TV and tune in to a news channel. Magazines require physical copies or digital access, which may require purchasing or subscribing to them.

### Do you think people can learn history from films or TV programs?
Yes, of course. People can learn history from films or TV programs to a certain extent. While films and TV programs can provide a narrative and visual representation of historical events, they often take creative liberties for storytelling purposes. This means that the accuracy and depth of historical information may vary. For me, for years, I thought a lot of history about Emperor Yongzheng was truth, but after reading the book, wow, there are many differences between them.

F: It's important to approach historical films and TV programs with a critical mindset and use them as a starting point for further exploration and research. Supplementing the information with reliable sources, such as books, documentaries, or academic resources, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of history. (personal example, For years, I thought this was the truth, but after doing my own research ....)

### Tell me about the types of programmes that are generally on television in your country.
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't know what types of TV programmes are generally in our country. Living in the era of the internet(Living in the internet era), I spend more time (streaming) online videos. I only know the national TV service called CCTV, which has many channels, (with) each one playing different programmes, such as documentary, sports, and so forth.

### Do you think state or private television is better?
I have no idea about the private television. In our country, we only have the national TV called CCTV service and satellite TVs from each province, such as Hunan Satellite TV. But with the development of the Internet, people have more opinions and flexibility in what they watch on streaming platforms. So things maybe no difference even through there is no private television in our country. 

(Enen though I dont know the ... things maybe no difference....)

### Let’s move on from TV programmes to television in general. How has TV changed our lives?
Television (TV) has profoundly transformed our lives. It has become a primary source of entertainment, providing a wide range of shows, movies, and sports events. TV also serves as a crucial medium for information and news, keeping us updated on current events. Educational programs on TV have made learning more accessible, especially for children. Through international channels, TV promotes cultural exchange and understanding. It has also influenced consumer behavior through advertisements.

### Should children be allowed to watch a lot of TV?
While TV can offer educational and entertainment benefits, it's crucial for us to be aware of the potential effects of excessive television watching, such as impaired vision. I recommend to set limits and ensure a healthy balance between TV, physical activity, social interactions, and other activities like reading or creative play.

### Are all people on TV famous?
Of course not all people on TV are famous. TV features a wide range of individuals, including actors, experts, journalists, and regular people who participate in reality shows or documentaries. But only a few people will succeed. Because TV just provides a platform for various people to share their talents or experiences. Ultimatly, success or not requires not only skills, but also a certain amount of luck.

### How popular is watching television in your country?
I think it's depends on the city you live in. People like me who live in a big city like Bejing, have to run around for a living every day, usually have no time watching TV. Even during moments of leisure, I would rather socialize with friends instead of watching TV at home along. 

### What effects can watching television have on children?
Watching TV is a double-edged sword for children. On the positive side, educational programmes can help children expand their horizons and enrich their experiences. However, excessive TV viewing can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and health issues. Additionally, watching TV close to bedtime can influence sleep quality. So it's crucial to set limits and ensure a healthy balance between TV, physical activity, social interactions, and other activities like reading or creative play.
