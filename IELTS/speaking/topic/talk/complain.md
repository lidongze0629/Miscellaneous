### Have you ever experienced a bad service? When? Where?

I visited a coffee shop one morning for a quick breakfast. The shop was not busy at that time, yet it took several minutes for the staff to acknowledge my presence. When I finally placed my order, the staff seemed uninterested and didn't provide any pleasantries or even a smile.

I ordered a cappuccino and a breakfast sandwich. However, after waiting for over 20 minutes, I only received my cappuccino. When I inquired about my sandwich, the staff seemed confused and then admitted they had forgotten to make it. They then proceeded to prepare the sandwich but did not offer any apologies for the oversight.

After another long wait, I received the sandwich, but it was not what I had ordered. By this time, I was running late and had to leave, so I decided not to correct the mistake.

### You have just received poor service. Describe the service to the manager.

"I visited your restaurant on [date] and was disappointed with the service I received. My order was incorrect and the server was dismissive when I pointed out the error. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and ensure it doesn't happen again."

Example 2: Defective Product
"I recently purchased a [product] from your online store. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I discovered it was damaged [provide details of the damage]. I have attached photographs as evidence. I would like a replacement or a full refund."

Answer: I'm sorry to hear that. It was our mistake in work, and I will give you some compesations, how about? Thanks for your understanding.
