### Do you think you have been a romantic person since birth?

Typically, The capacity to express romantic feelings is likely not present at birth.  No one is romantic at begining. The romance is determined by the growth environment, books you read and your experience. Sometimes, a movie, an artical or even fables can make you get through the true meaning of romance. However, some people are busy all their lives and cannot feel it. We certainly have the capacity to become romantic individuals through our interactions, experiences. It depends on your choice.


### What's romance?

Romance is a complex concept. Everyone has their own comprehensions. As for me, I think romance is you can live your life following your wishes.

Recently, I watched an Oscar short film "One minute fly". In fact, isn't our life like this? From the moment a person was born, he was actually on the way to death. So, how should we spend our short life?

There is famour saying in the book <How steel was Tempered>: Man's dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; And there is another saying in the book <Walden>: There is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it.

From now on, don’t live the life you should live, live the life you want to live. However, Living in a mountain of books, How do you know which book is not like you? How do you know which book is like you? how should we spend our short life? when facing this problem, Some people know it from birth, some people know it from teaching, some people know it from being trapped, and some people are ignorant forever, but so what? I think lots of people ignore a truth, that is some things don’t need meaning. Having fun does not mean wasting time, and enduring hardship does not mean being meaningful. So, you can do those seemingly meaningless things, like daze, like watching the sunrise, watching the stars. Because your experience is romance itself. Life is a wilderness, not a track. We cannot decide the length of life, but we can change its width. We can cultivate ourselves and improve ourselves so that our life will not be wasted.
