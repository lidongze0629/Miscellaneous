It depends on specific stage of the study. For elementary and middle school, music is just a general suject, same as mathematics and physics.

But after middle school, usually there is no music related subject, whether high school or college, unless you you go to a art school to learn music theory knowledge and painting skills.

### What kinds of music are (most) popular in your country?
I don't know what the most popular music is in my country. Maybe the top three are pop music, classic music, and folk music. Because it's crucial to note that musical preferences can vary among individuals and regions in China, and there are many other genres that have their own following. 

### Do you like to listen to live music?
I enjoy the experience of listening to live music. Live performances can offer me a unique and immersive atmosphere, allowing me to connect with the music and the artists on a more personal level. However, In China, tickets to celebrity concerts are hard to come by.

Over the years, there has been a significant growth in the live music scene, with a rise in the number of music festivals, concerts, and live performances across the country. Major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu have vibrant music scenes with numerous venues that cater to a variety of musical genres. Chinese audiences enjoy attending live music events to experience the energy and atmosphere of performances by both domestic and international artists. 

### Have you ever been to a concert before? Or Have you ever been to a musical performance?
Yes, I have. I was fortunate enough to secure two tickets for the concert of Jay Chou, a popular Chinese pop singer. It was in Inner Mongolia province of China. The time was in September 2023.

### How much time do you spend listening to music every day?
I rarely listen to music now. Instead, I listen to English listening.

I don't think so. I only listen to pop music.

 I really enjoy listening to pop music, specifically artists like Jay Chou. Firstly, Jay Chou is a highly talented and versatile musician. He is known for his unique style, blending elements of pop, rock, R&B, and traditional Chinese music. His compositions are often catchy, emotional, and relatable.

Additionally, Jay Chou's lyrics often touch on themes of love, relationships, and personal experiences, resonating with many listeners. His songs often have meaningful and thought-provoking messages that people can relate to and find comfort in.

Yes, singing along to favorite songs is a common way for people to engage with music and enhance their listening experience. I can express myself, relieve stress by singing along to songs. It can even satisfy my fantasy of becoming a singing star.

It is difficult to generalize preferences for music or art among the Chinese population, as individual tastes and interests can vary greatly. Some people may have a stronger affinity for music, while others may have a greater appreciation for visual arts. Both music and art have their dedicated enthusiasts in China.

### How does pop music now compare to when you were growing up?
I'm not an expert in this field, I personally think that when I was young, pop music tended to express love, but now in addition to love, it also includes nostalgia, ideals and aspirations.

### Is foreign music or music from your country more popular with people your age?
It's important to note that personal preferences for music can vary greatly from person to person, and there is a wide range of musical tastes in China. Some individuals may have a strong preference for traditional Chinese music, while others may gravitate more towards foreign music or have an appreciation for both.

Judging from the people around me, I believe the music from my country is more popular. The main reason is the internet had not yet achieved widespread accessibility during our childhood, so we rarely had the opportunity to listen to foreign songs.

### Let’s move on to the role of government on music. Do you think is it necessary for the government to require all children to learn music?
Obviously not. One the one hand, the andatory music education could limit individual freedom and choice. Not all children may have an interest in or aptitude for music, and forcing them to learn it could be seen as unnecessary or even counterproductive. It is important to recognize and respect diverse talents and interests among children.

On the other hand, the operation of the entire society requires various talents, and a large part of them do not require musical knowledge.

### Finally, let’s talk about illegal downloading of music. There’s a lot of pirated music. Do you agree that we should support official music?
Illegal downloading of music, including pirated copies, is a complex issue, It is generally agreed upon that supporting official music is important for several reasons, expecially from the perspective of creative rights. When you support official music, you respect and uphold the creative rights of artists. This means acknowledging their ownership of the music they create and recognizing their right to control how it is used and distributed. By purchasing or streaming music through official channels, you contribute to the financial well-being of artists, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their work.

### What are some possible advantages and disadvantages of being stricter about the illegal downloading of music?
Advantages of being stricter about illegal downloading include protecting artists' rights and ensuring they get fair compensation, promoting legal consumption to support the music industry, and creating a level playing field for artists and distributors. However, there are disadvantages. Enforcement can be challenging due to the decentralized nature of the internet. Some consumers may react negatively, as they're used to accessing music for free. Balancing privacy and freedom of information is important. Additionally, there's a risk of unintended consequences, like driving piracy to harder-to-detect platforms. Striking a balance is crucial in addressing the issue.

### Do you think CDs will have any role in the music industry in the future?
 CDs still have a niche market and appeal to collectors, audiophiles, and those who prefer physical copies of music. However, as technology continues to advance and digital media becomes increasingly accessible, it's likely that CDs will continue to diminish in popularity. Streaming services and digital downloads offer convenience and unlimited access to a vast library of music, making them the preferred choice for many. Ultimately, the future of CDs in the music industry may be limited, but they may still hold sentimental value for some and retain a small but devoted following.

### Do singers play an important role in your country?
Yes, singers play an important role in many countries, including mine. Singers are cultural ambassadors who express and preserve the artistic and musical traditions of a nation. They often contribute to the development of national identity and cultural heritage through their music. Singers also have a significant impact on the entertainment industry, shaping popular culture and influencing trends in music and fashion. They can inspire and connect with audiences, conveying emotions and messages through their performances.

However, it is important to note that the income of celebrities can vary greatly depending on factors such as their level of fame, demand, and the industry they work in. While some celebrities earn substantial wealth, it is not representative of all individuals in the entertainment industry.
