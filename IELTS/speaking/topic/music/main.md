## Part-1

### How ofter do you listen to music?
It has been a while since I listened to the music, instead, I tend to listen to news such CNN 10 for students to practice my listening skills.

### How do you listen to music before?
I used to listen to music through online streaming platform such QQ music. These platforms allow user to access a wide variety of songs, and backend algorithm could recommend suitable musics for you based on your preferences.

(Now) I listen to music through online streaming platforms such as "QQ music". These platforms allow user to access a vast library of songs and create personalized playlists. They will also recommend music that you may be interested in based on your preferences.

### When do you listen to music?
I usually listene to music on my commute to work. Because it's at least half an hour and is so boring.

### What’s your favorite kind of music?
I prefer lyrical or sentimental pop music, expecially the melody is quite captivating and the lyrics can resonate with me.

### Is music an important subject at school in your country?
It depends on specific stage of the study. For primary and secondary school, like mathematics and physics, music is just a basic course. The purpose of taking music lessons is to focus on fostering interest, without taking into account scores. I agree with this teaching method.

However, for the most high school in China, they often offer specialized programs catering to different fields of study, including both liberal arts and science. Science students in high school typically follow a curriculum that emphasizes subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology. While the liberal arts students have a curriculum that focuses more on subjects related to geography and history. But none of them involve the cultivation of artistic interests. If you are interested in music, you have to contact the teacher privately and pay the extra monry to learn music theory knowledge and apply for the corresponding colleges and universities. 

Therefore, I feel that starting from high school, our country does not pay much attention to the education of music and other arts.

### What kinds of music are (most) popular in your country?
I konw little about the music. and I don't know what the most popular music is in my country. Maybe the top three are pop music, classic music, and folk music. There are total of 34 provincial-level administrative regions in China, inhabited by 56 ethnic groups. So, the musical preferences can vary among individuals and regions, and there are many other genres that have their own following.

I don't really like listening to live music. I'm not chasing star, and I'm not very interested in music eigher. Moreover, in China, it is arduous to get tickets for concerts.

### Is live music popular in your country?
Yes, live music is quite popular in China. Over the years, there has been significant growth in the live music, such as music festivals and concerts. Chinese audiences enjoy attending these events, immersing themselves into the atmosphere, and even interact with their idols.

### Have you ever been to a concert before? Or Have you ever been to a musical performance?
Yes, I have. I was fortunate enough to get two tickets for the concert of Jay Chou, a popular Chinese singer. His songs have accompanied us throughout our entire youth.

### Are your music tastes varied?
I don't think so. I only listen to some of pop music or folk music.

### Do you like to sing along to your favourite songs?
Exactly yes. I prefer the sentimental music, expecially lyrics can resonate with me. The purpose of listening to music for me is to be able to sing it by myself. Only in this way, I can express emotions, relieve a little bit stress, and even satisfy my fantasy of becoming a star.

### Do people in your country prefer music over art?
I don't know the exact anster to this question. I have never delved into this matter before. Superficially, there are 34 provincial-level administrative regions in China, inhabited by 56 ethnic groups. So, their tastes and interests can vary greatly. Some people may have a stronger affinity for music, while others may have a greater appreciation for arts. Both music and art have their dedicated enthusiasts in China.

### How does pop music now compare to when you were growing up?
I personally think that when I was young, pop music tended to express love, but now in addition to love, it also includes nostalgia, ideals and aspirations.

### Is foreign music or music from your country more popular with people your age?
Judging from the people around me, I believe the music from my country is more popular, possibly this is due to the internet wasn't widely available during our childhood, so we rarely had the opportunity to listen to foreign songs. In addition, you have to know a little English, otherwise you won't understand the meaning of lyrics.

### Let’s move on to the role of government on music. Do you think is it necessary for the government to require all children to learn music?
Obviously not. On the one hand, not all children may have an interest in music. Forcing them to learn music could be seen as unnecessary or even counterproductive. It will limit individual freedom and choice. The government should respect the diverse talents among childern.

On the other hand, governments have to consider various skills for a well-rounded education. While music has its benefits, there are other subjects such as science, mathematics, languages that are also crucial for a child's development. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be practical or effective.

### What do you think about the pirated music?
It's been a while since I listened to this word. Over the years, the trend of pirated music has declined significantly. With the development of the Internet, the online streaming services purchase copyrights from the singer's economy company. Then, end user listen to these musics through the subscription. The entire process is under the supervision of the Internet, and there is almost no piracy involved. Even if there is, it is competition between companies and will not involve end users, so the scale is controllable.

### What are the pros and cons of pirated music?
The only advantage I can think is that users don't have to pay for music, but that's also the problem. Because artists might not receive adequate reward for their work. This can negatively impact the artists creativity and enthusiasm. Ultimately, it will destroy the entire industry.

### What are some possible advantages and disadvantages of being stricter about the illegal downloading of music?
todo

### Finally, let’s talk about illegal downloading of music. There’s a lot of pirated music. Do you agree that we should support official music?
Yes, of course. It is generally agreed upon that supporting official music is important for several reasons, expecially from the perspective of creative rights.

When you support official music, you respect the creative rights of artists. This means acknowledging their ownership of the music and recognizing their right to control how it is used and distributed. By purchasing through official channels, such as subscribe to online streaming services, you contribute to the finances of artists, ensuring they receive fair reward for their work. This will further inspire them to create more classic music.

### Do you think CDs will have any role in the music industry in the future?
As technology continues to advance and digital media becomes increasingly accessible, it's likely that CDs will continue to decline in popularity. Streaming services and digital downloads offer convenience and unlimited access to a wide variety of music, making them the preferred choice for many. But I still think CDs could have a nice market for the collectors, and those who prefer physical copies of music. CDs may be a liitle bit limited in the music industry in the future, but they may still hold sentimental value and retain a small but devoted following.

### Do singers play an important role in your country?
Yes, music is not merely collections of songs, but rather a vessel that carries culture. Through the music, singers can transmit culture to the public. For example, there is song which lyrics are all composed of rare characters that almost all Chinese people don't recognize. In addition, they can inspire people through their music, use their platform and reputation to raise awareness about the import issues or advocate for social change. In many cases, singers become cultural icons and their music becomes a significant part of a country's identity.

### Do you think celebrities have a lot of income?
In fact, compared with ordinary people, most celebrities have a lot of income. This is because they often earn substantial amounts of money through various methods such as brand endorsement, and appearance in films, television shows, or concerts.

However, it is not representative of all individuals in the entertainment industry can make a lot of money. The income of celebrities can greatly depend on many factors such as their level of fame, demand, and the industry they work in.

### Why do you think pop music is so popular?
Pop music is popular because it has catchy melodies and relatable lyrics.

Lots of pop music have memorable melodies and catchy hooks that stick in people's minds. These elements make the songs easy to sing along to. In addition, lyrics of pop music can resonate with listeners. When the lyrics touch on universal themes or emotions that people can relate to, it creates a strong connection between the artist and the audience.

Explain why it is your favourite song.

The name of my favourite song is "消愁" translates to "Alleviate Sorrow" in English. It is performed by singer-songwriter Mao Buyi. But I can't remember what year it was released.

This song explores the theme of finding solace in facing life's challenges and hardships. The lyrics convey a message of hope and encouragement, encouraging listeners to stay positive and persevere through difficult times.
